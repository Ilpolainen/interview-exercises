# Clojure base pack

This folder contains a very minimal, lightweight hello world application that can be built, tested, packaged, and run with Leiningen tool.

## Prerequisites

Clone this repository from git. You do not need to fork it or send your code anywhere, just clone the code for the live coding exercise.

You need to have Java installed. Any version from 8 is fine. Also install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) which takes care of installing Clojure and the rest of the dependencies.

You can use whatever editor/IDE which suits you. IntelliJ+Cursive, Emacs+CIDER, Visual Studio Code + Calva etc. are all fine.   

## Am I ready for the interview?

Run the tests and access the REPL:
```sh
lein test
lein repl
```

We very much want to see you in the interview at least:
* loading code to the REPL from the editor
* running tests from the REPL 

Done with all that! Congratulations! Now we can start coding immediately with your working environment. If you want to prepare for the interview, brush up on your basic Clojure and unit test skills a bit, then come with a relaxed attitude. Purpose is not to do any challenging coding, purpose is just to chat by some code, to get to know each others as coders. It's like fireside chat - just with less fire and more sweet, sweet Clojure hopefully!
