# Templates for online interview exercises

This repository contains code templates for various languages. Templates are pretty much on hello-world level. 
Idea is to choose a language, then examine the provided template, make it compile, if applicable, be able to run test automation, and be able to run it successfully, on your own machine.

Purpose of this repository is to make sure that before interview your machine is set up for live coding exercices.

Each folder contains more specific readme for what you need to do before interview.
